Other notes: My pause/play buttons require you to push it twice (so a total of four times to get from pausing to unpausing the game for the game to go back to the correct functionality). The same goes for when you open the leaderboard. In addition, I couldn't figure out / didn't have time to code how to add to the leaderboard, although I do have a preset leaderboard already. Finally, I couldn't figure out how to restart the clock at zero if the player wins/loses. Sorry about that but happy grading!
