# Overview
This is the classic Minesweeper game, where a player must navigate a grid of hidden mines using logical deduction. The grid represents a minefield, and each square either conceals a mine, number, or blank square. Players strategically click on squares; if they reveal a mine, the game ends. Numeric clues indicate the number of adjacent mines, aiding players in deducing mine locations. The objective is to clear the entire grid without detonating any mines. Minesweeper combines logic and probability, offering a captivating challenge that requires careful decision-making and memory. Success demands a mix of skill, strategy, and a touch of luck.

# Logistics
The interface comprises distinct tiles: one for numbered tiles, another for displaying mines, a third for revealing numbers of adjacent tiles, a fourth for empty tiles, and a fifth for hidden tiles. Users can mark tiles that they suspect contain mines by right-clicking on a tile, and a flag counter on the bottom left tracks the count. If the number of placed flags exceed 50, the counter goes negative. A game timer, located on the bottom right, records the duration of the game. Achieving a top-five time places the user on the leaderboard, accessible via the bottom right button next to the clock. Selecting the pause button defaults all tiles to the empty tile display, while the mine eyeball button aids debugging by revealing hidden mines. Lastly, when clicked, a smiley face button restarts the game.
